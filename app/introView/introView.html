    <p>CHAIR OF THE BOARD:</p>
    <h1>PATRICK McKENNA</h1>
    <p>Looking back on the past two years it is a genuine challenge to whittle down the highlights into a few
    words.</p>

    <p>Of course, there was the incomparable A View from the Bridge - at the Young Vic, in the West End and now
    on Broadway. We've welcomed some of the world's leading actors to our intimate stage. The amazing Gillian
    Anderson in A Streetcar Named Desire, another production on its way to New York.  The always brilliant
    Chiwetel Ejiofor in A Season in the Congo. Hattie Morahan's superb depiction of Nora in A Doll's House
    (which also transferred to the West End and played in New York).  Juliet Stevenson's remarkable
    performance as Winnie in two runs of Happy Days.</p>

    <p>Yet the thing about the Young Vic is that for every extraordinary high profile show there is always another
    gem running in a different space (or a different medium) at the same time. Sizwe Banzi is Dead directed by
    Matthew Xia, or Birdgang's brilliant new show Harlem Dream, both in the Maria. Or Belarus Free Theatre's
    short film Connection with Jude Law seen by over 100,000 people on various websites. Or the parallel
    production of The Scottsboro Boys created and performed by 20 local school children. Giving people the
    chance to try something new is at the heart of what we do and has created some of our most uplifting
    moments.</p>

    <p>Our biggest challenge will be, as it always is, creating as much excitement in the next two years as we have
    over the past 24 months.</p>

    <p>ARTISTIC DIRECTOR:</p>
    <h1>DAVID LAN</h1>
    <p>Over the last two years we've set off on many new adventures â in search of new artists, new audiences,
    new ways of making theatre.</p>

    <p>All of which means we're looking for new conversations at the deepest level about what we share, what
    brings us together - as well as the many things that force us apart, sometimes without too much damage,
    too often violently.</p>

    <p>More and more I feel that the meaning of what happens between an audience and a show on a stage is
    found in the total experience of a particular moment in a particular place. Yes, of course, the genius of the
    writer, yes the miracle of great acting, great directing, great design â yes the towering waves of ideas and
    the tsunami of emotions. But meaning is also in the act of a group of strangers coming together peacefully,
    in good faith and with high expectations that something will happen that will somehow cause something
    important to change.</p>

    <p>If the Young Vic has a special quality, perhaps it's that we never give up believing that that, above anything
    else, is what we're here for â to clear a terrain on which whatever it is â the temporary community that,
    night after night, great art creates - can come into being, and then vanish again into the night.</p>

    <p>And sometimes it actually happens. Our A Streetcar Named Desire, Happy Days, The Scottsboro Boys, The
    Cherry Orchard, Golem, The Valley of Astonishment, A Season in the Congo were all game changers in their
    different ways. And many felt that our A View from the Bridge changed theatre in this country for good. I
    hope it did.</p>

    <p>I also hope you'll come on many new adventures as we head off into more risk taking conversations about
    what matters to all who gather here â artists new-found and well-established, all trying their deft hands at
    something new - and audiences drawn from every part of our city - every class, every background, every
    age.</p>

    <p>EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR:</p>
    <h1>LUCY WOOLLATT</h1>
    <p>Over the period of this review, the Young Vic has produced a range of shows which, at first glance, would
    appear to be beyond the possible.  With public investment of just less than Â£1.8m, a 420 seat main house
    and two smaller studios, our opportunity to produce appears limited.</p>

    <p>However, we understand how essential it is for a company like ours to take risks, to challenge and stretch
    the abilities of our team, to give opportunities to artists that they wouldn't get elsewhere.</p>

    <p>We look after our artists well.  We provide them with the resources they need to create the best work.  At
    the same time, we are careful with our money, ensuring not a penny is wasted.</p>

    <p>What interests us is the relationship between risk and reward, between doing too much and too little.  An
    obsession with trimming cost can result in bad decisions.  Our biggest recent show The Scottsboro Boys
    triggered over Â£1m in co-production investment, our most expensive set for A Streetcar Named Desire
    enabled us to install the highest number of seats (520) that our auditorium can contain, our highly
    ambitious A Season in the Congo gave us our most diverse audience, our risky âunknown' director Ivo Van
    Hove directing A View From the Bridge with a team brought over from Amsterdam resulted in an extension
    at the Young Vic, a West End transfer and a season on Broadway (as well as the recreation of our production
    in French in Paris).</p>

    <p>It is the special qualities of a so-called ânot for profit' business that we will continue to explore.  The point
    about a ânot for profit' is simply that it has different priorities from enhancing the profits of share-holders.
    When our work, supported by public investment, enthusiastic and effective fund raising and past box-office
    receipts makes a profit, we are of course delighted.  The money goes right back into our budget to support
    the work that we always aim to produce with our artists for our audience at the highest possible level.</p>
