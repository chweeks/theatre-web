  <h1>EMERGING DIRECTORS<h1>

  <p>Launched in 2000, our Directors Program is the only scheme of its kind in the UK.  Throughout 2013-15  we offered 391 activities, with over 2800 places for emerging directors, from assistant directorships to skills-based workshops to CV clinics â all to help directors develop their craft.</p>

  <p>The Genesis Fellow is a two year role that enables its recipients to work
  closely with artistic director David Lan as they continue to develop their
  craft as a theatre director. Each year they also have the opportunity to
  direct their own show either in the Maria Theatre or main house.</p>

  rehearse and present a play of their choice, as part of the Young Vicâs
  season.</p>

  <h4>Genesis Network
  supported by the
  Genesis</h4>

  <p>Our web-based network helps directors to discuss theatre, form groups
  and organise skills sharing, as well as to find information about current
  activities, opportunities and special ticket offers.  Directing can be
  lonely â particularly in the early stages of a career â and the network
  encourages a sense of community and peer support.  We now have
  nearly 1,000 members.</p>

  <p>Learning from experienced directors by assisting and spending
  sustained time in a theatre are vital for a directorâs development.  Each
  year the Jerwood Charitable Foundation supports us in providing
  assistant directorships which include a residency at the Young Vic, an
  attachment to a production, an international to see work and met
  artists and the opportunity to develop and direct a short play with a
  writer.</p>

TRAINEE ASSISTANT
DIRECTORS SCHEME

âThis was such a wonderful
and practical experience for
me to have had; to propel
me into directing, I feel so
much confident in my
abilities and I couldnât have
asked to work with a better
director, at this stage in my
career.â

With the support of the Boris Karloff Charitable Foundation we seek to
diversify our talent pool and find the most exciting talent. The scheme
bridges the gap between training or engaging with our Taking Part
department and embarking on a professional career.  Many of the
participants have not been through formal higher education and are
from Black, Asian and ethnic minority communities.
