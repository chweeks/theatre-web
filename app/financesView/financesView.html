      <h1>OUR SHOWS</h1>

      <h4>The teams who create, produce, manage, build and sell our shows <br>
        are talented and highly motivated. Our actors, writers, directors and <br>
        designers are among the best in the world.</h4>

      <h4>Producing our ambitious and innovative work is expensive and <br>
        involves risk. Each risk we take is calculated and strategic, designed <br>
        to produce long term benefit to ourselves as well as to the wider <br>
        artistic world. Each show needs to be work in its own right and, at <br>
        the same time, R&D for the shows that come after. In other words, <br>
        we respond to existing markets but also create new ones. The cost <br>
        of this approach, sustained over time (we produce between 12 and <br>
        14 shows a year) cannot be met by ticket sales alone.</h4>

      <h4>From 2013-15 our tickets ranged from £10 to £35 with a range of <br>
        concessions available. At least 50% of the audience at each <br>
        performance pay less than £20.</h4>

      <h4>As we play to consistently full houses, the only way we can increase <br>
        box office income is by raising prices, by abandoning concessions or <br>
        by withdrawing our funded ticket schemes. For reasons outlined <br>
        throughout the review, to take any of these steps would damage <br>
        the benign circle “great art, low prices, diverse audience” that we <br>
        have imagined, created, and sustained over the past decade.</h4>

      <h2>EXPENDITURE</h2>

      <h4>Each year more than 90% of our total resource goes towards <br>
        the shows you see on our three stages, our ‘taking part’ <br>
        activities and our flagship directors programme. Less than 10% <br>
        is spent on overheads.</h4>

      <h4>Of the 90%, one quarter goes on the salaries of our permanent <br>
        staff – producers, heads of lighting, sound and stage, <br>
        marketeers, production accountants and theatre managers. <br>
        The other three quarters goes on the direct costs of our <br>
        productions – the actors, the director, the designer, the set and <br>
        costumes and so on.</h4>

      <h3>SALARIES 25%</h3>
      <h3>PRODUCTIONS 75%</h3>

      <h2>INCOME</h2>

      <h4>Our income comes from the sale of our tickets, our <br>
        fundraising, our co producers and our grant from the Arts <br>
        Council England. Our grant makes up less than a quarter of <br>
        our income. We generate the other three quarters by the <br>
        careful marketing and pricing of our tickets (over recent <br>
        years we have played to 95% capacity) and by regular and <br>
        close engagement with the co producers, individuals, trusts <br>
        and corporates that support us. Each year we raise well over <br>
        £1.25m million in this way and, in addition, raise substantial <br>
        sums, sometimes up to £1m, by co-producing with other <br>
        theatres in the UK and abroad.</h4>

      <h3>GRANT 25%</h3>
      <h3>DEVO 18%</h3>
      <h3>BOX OFFICE 40%</h3>
      <h3>CO PROD 15%</h3>
