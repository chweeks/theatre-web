  <h1>OUR SHOWS</h1>

  <p>The teams who create, produce, manage, build and sell our shows are talented and highly motivated.
  Our actors, writers, directors and designers are among the best in the world.</p>

  <p>Producing our ambitious and innovative work is expensive and involves risk. Each risk we take is calculated and strategic,
  designed to produce long term benefit to ourselves as well as to the wider artistic world.
  Each show needs to be work in its own right and, at the same time, R&D for the shows that come after.
  In other words, we respond to existing markets but also create new ones. The cost of this approach,
  sustained over time (we produce between 12 and 14 shows a year) cannot be met by ticket sales alone.</p>

  <p>From 2013-15 our tickets ranged from £10 to £35 with a range of concessions available.
  At least 50% of the audience at each performance pay less than £20.</p>

  <p>As we play to consistently full houses, the only way we can increase box office income is by raising prices,
  by abandoning concessions or by withdrawing our funded ticket schemes. For reasons outlined throughout the review,
  to take any of these steps would damage the benign circle “great art, low prices, diverse audience” that we have imagined,
  created, and sustained over the past decade.</p>

  <h2>EXPENDITURE</h2>

  <p>Each year more than 90% of our total resource goes towards the shows you see on our three stages,
  our ‘taking part’ activities and our flagship directors programme. Less than 10% is spent on overheads.</p>

  <p>Of the 90%, one quarter goes on the salaries of our permanent staff – producers, heads of lighting,
  sound and stage, marketeers, production accountants and theatre managers.
  The other three quarters goes on the direct costs of our productions – the actors,
  the director, the designer, the set and costumes and so on.</p>

  <h3>SALARIES 25%</h3>
  <h3>PRODUCTIONS 75%</h3>

  <h2>INCOME</h2>

  <p>Our income comes from the sale of our tickets, our fundraising, our co producers and our grant from the Arts Council England.
  Our grant makes up less than a quarter of our income.
  We generate the other three quarters by the careful marketing and pricing of our tickets (over recent years we have played to 95% capacity)
  and by regular and close engagement with the co producers, individuals, trusts and corporates that support us.
  Each year we raise well over £1.25m million in this way and, in addition, raise substantial sums, sometimes up to £1m,
  by co-producing with other theatres in the UK and abroad.</p>
