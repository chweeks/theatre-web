  <h2>A VIEW FROM THE BRIDGE</h2>

  <p>Described as “one of the great theatrical productions of the decade”,
  this outstanding performance of Arthur Miller’s play sold out even before it opened at the Young Vic and went on to win 3 Olivier Awards.
  It transferred to the Wyndham’s Theatre in the West End and will be the first Young Vic production to be transferred to Broadway.</p>

  <h2>COLUMBITE TANTALITE CHIWETEL EJIOFOR<h2>

  <p>Chiwetel (12 Years a Slave, Dirty Pretty Things) directed this short film, based on the Young Vic’s Main Stage production of A Season in the Congo,
  the epic retelling of a vibrant nation’s turbulent first year of freedom. The film won a prestigious Webby Award before touring international film festivals.</p>

  <h2>THE SOUND OF YELLOW</h2>

  <p>Taking Part Production</p>

  <p>The Sound of Yellow was inspired by our main house production, The Valley of Astonishment directed by Peter Brook and Marie-Helene Estienne.
  The Sound of Yellow was an interactive multi-sensory show which told the story of intermingled senses. The audience experienced the production through sound, taste and texture.</p>

  <h2>DIVERSITY IN THEATRE</h2>

  <p>Over the last two years we have led the UK in producing theatre of black experience. Following the 2013 production of Feast,
  which brought together 5 writers from 5 countries to explore the Yoruba cosmology, and A Season in the Congo where Chiwetel Ejiofor played Patrice Lumumba,
  we produced two acclaimed runs of Sizwe Banzi is Dead followed by a national small scale tour,
  a JMK award winner directed The Island (both of the last by Athol Fugard) and a sold out run of The Scottsboro Boys,
  which transferred to the West End and received the 2014 Evening Standard Award for Best Musical.</p>

  <p>In addition to this the Young Vic associate dance company BirdGang put on a contemporary harlem renaissance and hip hop production of A Harlem Dream,
  2014 Genesis Future Award winner Tinuke Craig directed the compelling drama Dirty Butterfly,
  and Oh my Sweet Land explored the crisis in Syria through the stories of some of its 2 million refugees.</p>
