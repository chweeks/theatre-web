        <h2>CONNECTION</h2>
        <h4>Two actors with very different concerns meet at an airport and find that they have <br>
          more in common than it at first seems. Inspired by a real-life incident and by <br>
          Belarus Free Theatre, the film was written by Nicolai Khalezin and Laura Wade, <br>
        stars Nicolai Khalezin and Jude Law and is directed by Vladimir Shcherban.</h4>

        <h4>A SHORT FILM BY CHIWETEL EJIOFOR</h4>

        <h4>The latest in a series of short feature collaborations between the Young Vic and <br>
          the Guardian, this short film is written and directed by Chiwetel Ejiofor. It's a <br>
          postcolonial parable about the west's hunger for African mineral wealth, and <br>
          about Congo's struggle to come to terms with its past - a contemporary response <br>
          to Aimé Césaire's A Season in the Congo, which played at the Young Vic theatre <br>
          earlier in 2013.</h4>

          production in 2014. The film takes place in the days before Blanche arrives at her <br>
          sister Stella's home. The Departure is directed by Gillian Anderson and written by <br>
