    <h3>COLUMBITE TANTALITE</h3>

    <h4>A SHORT FILM BY CHIWETEL EJIOFOR</h4>

    <p>The latest in a series of short feature collaborations between the Young Vic and the Guardian,
    this short film is written and directed by Chiwetel Ejiofor. It's a postcolonial parable about the west's hunger for African mineral wealth,
    and about Congo's struggle to come to terms with its past - a contemporary response to Aimé Césaire's A Season in the Congo,
    which played at the Young Vic theatre earlier in 2013.</p>
